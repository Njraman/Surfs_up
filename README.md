## __Analysis:__

From the results it can be observed that there is very little difference in the average temperatures between June and December. The standard deviation from the mean is also nearly the same for both months.The low standard deviation shows that the temperatures are more clustered around the mean, for both months. 

The temperature range - difference between the minimum and maximum temperature is slightly higher in December than in June because of lower minimum temperature in December.

From this it can be undestood that both June and December present nearly the same average temperature conditions. While in December the minimum remperature may be lower, as the day progresses, the temperatures do get warmer with maximum temperatures reaching upto 83 degrees. 

This signifies that the temperatures remain favorable for an ice cream and surf shop throughout the year - both in summer and winter months.
