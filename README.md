## __Analysis:__

From the results it can be observed that there is very little difference in the average temperatures between June and December. The standard deviation from the mean is also nearly the same for both months.The low standard deviation shows that the temperatures are more clustered around the mean, for both months. 

The temperature range - difference between the minimum and maximum temperature is slightly higher in December than in June because of lower minimum temperature in December.

From this it can be undestood that both June and December present nearly the same average temperature conditions. While in December the minimum remperature may be lower, as the day progresses, the temperatures do get warmer with maximum temperatures reaching upto 83 degrees. 

This signifies that the temperatures remain favorable for an ice cream and surf shop throughout the year - both in summer and winter months.

The following additional queries can be written to study weather conditions:

### __Precipitation Data:__

 Queries can be written to extract the precipitation data and summary statistics for the months of June and December. This along with the temperature data provides good information to make decisions about starting the new business. The following images are the results of the same:

 ### Precipitation Statistics for December:

From the above it can be observed that the average precipitation is lower in June than in December, but the difference is not too high. Also the average precipitation in both seasons is low enough to make the surf and ice cream shop a viable business in the area.
